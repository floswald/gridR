Description: gridR is a package that helps with a fundamental problem in function approximation: where to place the grid points at which to measure the function. There are various ways to derive differently scaled points from a uniform grid in the package. There is also a helper function to setup a knot vector as an input to splineDesign. The user can decide the exact position of knots, or specify the desired number of basis functions (similar to what you do with df in ns. In fact, this function can be viewed as an extension to ns, where only (natural) cubic spline basis are supported. All functions have a plotting method to help guide the user.
